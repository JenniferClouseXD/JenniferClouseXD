        <h2>The Firehouse Subs Story</h2>
        <p>People come back when they’re treated well and fed well. Turns out, people absolutely LOVE the same
          things as our Founders the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. Take our Hook & Ladder® Sub for
          example, with Virginia honey ham, smoked turkey breast, and melted Monterey Jack.People come back again
          and again because, unlike other sub places, we steam our meats and cheeses,
          releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that’s way over code on one of our toasted
          private-recipe sub rolls. It’s a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the
          value-conscious alike.</p>
        <p>At Firehouse Subs, subs are only part of our story. A portion of your purchase in 2022 at all US
          Firehouse Subs locations goes to the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, to be used to provide
          lifesaving equipment to first responders. Since the Foundation started, it has granted over $71 million to
          provide equipment, training, and support to hometown heroes.</p>
